# Hi 👋

Young French 🇨🇵 entrepreneur 🧔 with a passion for the web 💻 and graphic design 🖌️

I followed a training in web development until obtaining a license in this field at OpenClassrooms 🎓

Freelance for 4 years, I realized many projects 💼 using various technologies and always trying to deliver a quality, modern and professional product.

Looking forward to meeting you.

See you soon! 😉
